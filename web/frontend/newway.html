<h1>JavaScript the <i>New</i> Way</h1>

<p>The new way of writing JavaScript is to install modules from npm, write your JavaScript with those modules, and bundle those up into a new JavaScript files that you include with a script tag. You'll need a few extra tools.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You'll need to install Node.js and npm. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Download here</a>

<p>Check that worked by running <code>npm</code> and making sure it actually prints something out.</p>

<p>Install <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a> with <code>npm install -g browserify</code></p>

<p>Install <a href="https://github.com/substack/watchify">watchify</a> with <code>npm install -g watchify</code></p>


<h3>The New Way</h3>
<p>
    Step 1: Make sure prerequisites are installed, or install them if they are not.
</p>

<p>
    Step 2: Set up your directory with npm init.
    <br>
    <pre>
    npm init
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    Step 3: Install any npm modules you'd like to use. In this example I used two modules.
    <br>
    <pre>
    npm install --save arithmetic
    npm install --save repeat-string
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    Step 4: Write your JavaScript. You can include these files by "requiring" them at the top.
    <br>

    <pre>
    var arithmetic = require('arithmetic');
    arithmetic.add(2, 4);
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    Step 5: Bundle your JavaScript. You can do this with a tool like browserify, which takes your JavaScript, and the dependency modules, and puts them into one file.
    <br>

    <pre>
    browserify newway.js -o bundle.js
    </pre>

    If you use browserify like this, you'll have to make a new bundle every time you make a change. To make it a bit easier, you can run this watchify command, which will create your new bundle every time you save your file.

    <pre>
    watchify newway.js -o bundle.js
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    Step 6: Now you include a script tag with bundle.js
    <br>

    <pre>
    &lt;script src="bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
</p>

<p>Include the script tag generated by the build tool.

<pre>
&lt;!-- Include a bundle which was generated. --&gt;
&lt;script src="bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
